# FlowerShopReact

This is my first React Project with a friend. We used ReactJS to create an e-commerce, single page app to sell Flowers ( Plants). 
We used Redux to manage states in React and stored data in MockAPI.
We also tried to implement Agile/Scrum method by writing backlogs and follow 4 sprints ( 1 week per ). 
We used Git to control our source code.
After doing this, i have learned  :
 + how to work with APIs
 + the workflow of Redux and ReactJS
 + how to responsive a page correctly
 + how to debug 
 + how to work in a team, Agile, Git.
 + the workflow of a e-commerce app
 ...
 My roles : 
 Hope this will be a big jump for me to make better applications in the future.
 Thanks for your time !
